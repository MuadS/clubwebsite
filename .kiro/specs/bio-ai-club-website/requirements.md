# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing club website project into a comprehensive UH Med-Tech Society website that showcases machine learning projects, provides interactive demos, and serves as a hub for club activities. The website should feature a prominent Universal Tumor Detector demo, project showcase cards, member profiles, and upcoming events, all built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for easy deployment and maintenance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the UH Med-Tech Society website, I want to see upcoming events on the homepage, so that I can stay informed about club activities and explore the club's work.

4. WHEN a user accesses any page THEN the system SHALL display consistent branding and styling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a potential collaborator or researcher, I want to try the Universal Tumor Detector demo immediately, so that I can evaluate the club's ML capabilities without browsing through multiple pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the projects page THEN the system SHALL display the tumor detector demo prominently at the top
2. WHEN a user uploads a histology image THEN the system SHALL process it through the ML model
3. WHEN the model processes an image THEN the system SHALL return a malignancy heat-map visualization
4. IF the upload fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
5. WHEN the model is processing THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor interested in the club's work, I want to browse all ML projects in a visual grid format, so that I can quickly identify projects that interest me and learn more about them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the projects page THEN the system SHALL display project cards in a responsive grid layout
2. WHEN a user hovers over a project card THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback with a subtle scale effect
3. WHEN a user clicks on a project card THEN the system SHALL navigate to the detailed project page
4. WHEN viewing project cards THEN the system SHALL display project title and brief description
5. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the grid layout responsively
6. IF no projects are currently deployed, THEN a corresponding message will be displayed.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As someone researching a specific ML project, I want to read detailed information about individual projects, so that I can understand the methodology, dataset, and results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses an individual project page THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive project details
2. WHEN viewing a project page THEN the system SHALL include sections for Problem & Dataset, Method, and Try it yourself
3. WHEN on a project page THEN the system SHALL provide navigation back to the projects hub
4. WHEN a user wants to interact with the project THEN the system SHALL provide demo functionality or external links
5. IF a project page doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL display a 404 error page

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a prospective member or collaborator, I want to learn about the club's executive team, so that I can understand who leads the organization and their areas of expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN viewing member profiles THEN the system SHALL show headshots, roles, and brief bios
3. WHEN the about page loads THEN the system SHALL arrange member profiles in a responsive grid
4. WHEN viewing on different devices THEN the system SHALL maintain readable member information
5. WHEN member information is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect changes without code modifications

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the website, I want a clean, framework-free codebase with clear file organization, so that I can easily add new projects and update content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new project THEN the system SHALL require only copying a template file and updating content
2. WHEN deploying the website THEN the system SHALL work on Netlify, Vercel, or Cloudflare without build steps
3. WHEN viewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only
4. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL follow a logical directory structure
5. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL use consistent CSS classes and utility patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user accessing the website from various devices, I want a responsive design that works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile, so that I can have a good experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the website on mobile THEN the system SHALL display content in a single-column layout
2. WHEN viewing on tablet THEN the system SHALL adapt grid layouts to available screen space
3. WHEN using touch devices THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets for interactive elements
4. WHEN the viewport changes THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition between responsive breakpoints
5. WHEN loading on any device THEN the system SHALL maintain fast loading times and good performance
